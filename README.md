### [Part 0. Types of database](part-0-types-of-database/README.md)

#### Must-Know database types

In this section, I introduced the different types of databases and each of their characteristics. By understanding these types of databases, we can gain a broader understanding of the database landscape and recognize that `MySQL` is just one example of a DBMS (Database Management System) that uses a relational database. After finishing this `MySQL` masterbook, you can expand your knowledge by exploring other databases that interest you armed with the knowledge of different types of databases I covered here.

I strongly recommend revisiting this section after completing the rest of this masterbook. If you return to Part 0 after learning how to use SQL, you will discover things you didn't notice before.

- Key-Value Database
- Relational Database
- Graph Database
- Document Database
- Search Engine Database

### [Part 1. Creating and manipulating databases : CRUD I](part-1/README.md)

#### How to create and manipulate databases and tables!

Initially, this masterbook focused on manipulating tables using a DBMS. However, I later decided to shift the focus on manipulating databases using SQL syntax. If you are interested in learning how to manipulate databases using a DBMS, you may want to explore tools such as `MySQL Workbench` and `DBeaver`.

In this part, I have introduced how to create and use databases using SQL syntax. Additionally, you will learn how to perform `CRUD` operations which stands for `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete`! By the end of this part, you will have acquired the skills necessary to create and manipulate databases, tables, and data in tables.

- Create & Delete a database and a table
  - Create a new database
  - Delete an existing database
  - Create a new table
  - Delete an existing table
- Manage columns in a table
- `CRUD`ing data

### [Part 2. SQL Data Types & CRUD II](part-2/README.md)

#### SQL data types, and more about manipulating tables!

This section is an extension of Part 1. We will revisit the same DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Management Language) syntax. However, here we will also learn more about the constraints that we can use to define tables, allowing us to update data more safely and debug more easily. Additionally, I will introduce SQL data types, which are necessary for querying data more efficiently and accurately.

- SQL Data Types
- Add Constraints to your table
